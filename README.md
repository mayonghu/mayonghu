ðŸ’•I like front-end programming best. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Java in college, and then I taught myself Python. I'm good at HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3, and I like pages rendered by code. I try to present my ideas as much as I can, and I think it's fantastic, and I love front-end development.
